## Attenetion

- Although there are some image files that have an uppercase suffix (e.g. IMG_8752.JPG), you need to change them to **lowercase** (e.g. IMG_8752.jpg) and reference them correctly in markdown. Please make sure that the images with the **correct filenames have been updated in GitHub**, otherwise the build may **fail** in GitHub.

- You can get some help about the website config from [here](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/zh/config/intro.html)
