# The Optimus Prime dataset

## Introduction

The Optimus Prime dataset is constructed by the Lab of Smart Data and Signal Processing, School of Informatics, Xiamen University (SmartDSP, XMU). Thanks for the data provided by Anhui Guolian Information Technology Co., Ltd. This dataset is captured in real-world highway scenarios by multiple surveillance cameras installed in several cities in China. All images are in 4K resolution and are captured from different camera viewpoints in front of big trucks. It collects a total of 130,994 images of 17,835 trucks, which are captured in a 24-hour-a-day uninterrupted manner. It is worth mentioning that truck images are reminiscent of the Transformers named in film and deep learning. Therefore, we name this dataset “Optimus Prime (Opri)”. The following figure shows sample images of the Opri dataset.
